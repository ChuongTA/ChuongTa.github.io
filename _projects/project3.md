**DENSYS Biomass-to-Liquid Project — January 2025**

Authored by: Dang Chuong TA & Oluwajoba Elisalome Oyefusi

This project evaluates diverse biomass-to-liquid (BtL) conversion pathways for sustainable transport fuels, comparing Fischer-Tropsch, hydrothermal liquefaction, pyrolysis, alcohol-to-jet, microbial and algal routes, and advanced electrolysis-based processes.

## What We Did

- Conducted multi-criteria analysis of seven major BtL technologies: carbon/energy efficiency, cost, readiness, environmental impacts, flexibility, scalability.
- Modeled future deployment scenarios (2025–2050) for commercial and emerging processes.
- Visualized results with spider plots, tables, and timeline diagrams.
- Assessed technological barriers and strategies for decarbonized fuel production.
- Composed the final report using LaTeX, leveraging icons and advanced formatting for clarity and impact.

## Key Results

- Fischer-Tropsch and HTL processes lead short-term commercialization; advanced electrolysis and algal-based routes hold future promise.
- Cost and system integration define large-scale viability of sustainable aviation and transport fuels.
- Effective use of co-products and system integration essential for economic and environmental performance.
