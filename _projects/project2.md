**Case-Based Module Assignment: Decarbonizing Aviation with Algae-Based SAF**

This project, part of the DENSYS Master's program, assessed sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production from microalgae. Our team evaluated major algae-to-jet fuel processes—Fischer-Tropsch (FT), Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids (HEFA), and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ)—by comparing land use, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and cost.

## What We Did

- Selected and compared optimal algae species (Nannochloropsis sp., Chlorella vulgaris) for each SAF pathway.
- Modeled large-scale cultivation, harvesting, and drying systems for industrial SAF supply.
- Analyzed FT, HEFA, and ATJ conversion processes, highlighting yield efficiency, environmental impact, and technological readiness.
- Quantified land requirements, carbon sequestration, and life-cycle emissions for French and global aviation demand scenarios.
- Performed economic assessment of SAF pathways and compared them with conventional jet fuels.

## Key Findings

- **HEFA** from Nannochloropsis sp. offers the lowest GHG emissions and highest land-use/cost efficiency, though still 3.9x costlier than conventional jet fuel.
- Drying is the most CO2‑intensive stage; advancements in renewable energy and drying technology are critical.
- Switching to renewable energy for processing could make HEFA SAF nearly carbon-negative.
