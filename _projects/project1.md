About this course: Data and Forecasting in Microgrids is my favourite course in DENSYS. From this I started love programming which is the thing I was very scary in the past. But now, I love it 😊.

**Academic Assignment for Energy Systems Module — Université de Liège**

This project was completed as part of the Energy Systems module, taught by:

- Prof. Bertrand Cornlusse
- Clément Moureau
- Thomas Stegen

## What We Did

- Developed and simulated microgrid models for operational planning and system sizing.
- Minimized operational costs and optimized asset usage (PV, battery, grid, generator, EV) under realistic physical and economic constraints.
- Analyzed system behavior and monthly/annual trends to guide renewable integration strategies.
- Performed microgrid sizing using optimization (MINLP), balancing capital (investment) and operational costs for various scenarios (e.g., changing tariffs, load, and EV use).
- Prepared a comprehensive technical report with analysis, code, results, and recommendations.

## Documentation

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pyomo, Pandas)
- Data visualization & cost analysis
- Optimization with MINLP (Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming)
- Technical writing
