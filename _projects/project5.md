## Project Overview

This study evaluates repowering the **Veggerslev wind farm** in Norddjurs, Denmark by replacing three aging **Vestas V44-600 turbines** (1.8 MW, commissioned 1998) with a single modern **Vestas V82-1.65 MW turbine** at 80m hub height [file:68]. Results demonstrate **33.3% increase in annual energy production** (4,750→6,331 MWh/year), **38.4% LCOE reduction** ($67.7→$41.7/MWh), positive NPV of $1.38M, IRR of 11.2%, and 7.87-year payback period [file:68].

## What We Did

- **Wind Climate Analysis:** WAsP modeling and logarithmic wind profile analysis showing strongest winds from west/southwest (4.6-13.87 m/s) [file:68]
- **Performance Simulation:** Compared original farm (4.75 GWh AEP, 30.1% capacity factor) vs. repowered (6.33 GWh AEP, 43.7% capacity factor) [file:68]
- **Grid Connection Design:** 7.5 km MV cable and 30 kV/132 kV transformer achieving 93.6% efficiency [file:68]
- **Economic Evaluation:** LCOE, NPV, IRR, and payback analysis over 20-year lifetime with 5.5% WACC [file:68]

## Key Results

| Metric | Old Farm (V44) | New Farm (V82) | Change |
|--------|----------------|----------------|--------|
| AEP (MWh/year) | 4,750 | 6,331 | +33.3% |
| Capacity Factor | 30.1% | 43.7% | +13.6 pp |
| LCOE ($/MWh) | 67.7 | 41.7 | -38.4% |
| NPV ($) | -439,889 | +1,381,769 | +$1.82M |
| IRR (%) | 3.1 | 11.2 | +8.1 pp |
| Payback (years) | 14.7 | 7.87 | -46.5% |

**Technical Drivers:** Higher hub height (80m vs 40m), improved capacity factor (43.7% vs 30.1%), modern reliability (98% vs 93% availability), reduced OPEX (67.3% reduction) [file:68].
