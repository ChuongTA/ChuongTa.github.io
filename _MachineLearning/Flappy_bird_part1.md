Have you heard of *Flappy Bird* before? It's a famous mobile game developed by a Vietnamese creator in 2014. His name is Dong Nguyen (also known as Nguyen Ha Dong). He was born in Hanoi and studied at Hanoi University of Science and Technology (HUST)—the same university I attended.
The gameplay is quite simple. It's a "side-scroller" where the player controls a bird by tapping the screen to fly through gaps between green pipes.

The idea that inspired me to code this came from a YouTube video. It showed how you can apply deep learning models to classic games like Flappy Bird, Dinosaur, or Snake. I found it fascinating, so I decided to start by coding Flappy Bird myself. As a Vietnamese developer, I'm proud to recreate it and share it with you! In the second post, I'll walk you through applying deep learning to it.
Let's jump into the coding instructions!
