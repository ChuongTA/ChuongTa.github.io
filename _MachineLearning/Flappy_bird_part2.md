Welcome to the 2nd post in this series on coding Flappy Bird with simple ANN.

The original code was written by Max Rohowsky. You can find the instruction video in [this link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsGvCwaaMOI&pp=ygUzZmxhcHB5IGJpcmQgZGVlcCBsZWFybmluZyBmcm9tIHNjcmF0Y2ggbm8gbGlicmFyaWVz)

In this post, I will re explain it in more detail for beginners. And, I think it is also a good way to remember
and understand by myself as well.

Below is the graphical abstract of the full codes with 8 different python files:

There are three main steps in implementation:
•	Step 1: Building a Flappy Bird game
•	Create an empty window
•	Add the ground
•	Add the pipes
•	Add a player
•	Implement movement, collision, and gravity
•	Create a population of players
•	Step 2: Neural network
•	Step 3: Natural selection algorithm
Step 1: Building the Flappy Bird game
To build the game, we use eight Python files, which are shown and described in Figure 1
