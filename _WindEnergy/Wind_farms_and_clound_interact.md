excerpt: "Offshore wind farms become larger and wind turbines become higher and higher every year. And they stir up the air and change how low clounds form over the ocean."

Offshore wind farms are growing rapidly because winds over the ocean are strong, steady, and far from populated areas. At the same time, large areas of the world’s oceans are covered by marine stratocumulus: low, sheet‑like clouds that strongly cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back to space. As offshore wind farms become larger (tens to hundreds of turbines), they start to measurably modify the marine boundary layer (MBL)—the lowest kilometre of air directly influenced by the sea surface [2](http://www.srderoode.nl/pubs/Wind_Energy_Clouds.pdf).

This raises a natural question:
"When you put a very large wind farm under a deck of low clouds, do the turbines and the clouds start to affect each other in a systematic way?"
